                "text": "Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) have been implemented by only a handful of countries. CBDCs are digital currencies issued and backed by a central bank. Consumer trust can encourage or discoura ge the adoption of this currency, which is also a payment system and a technology. Governments want a currency and payment solution that is more efficient and intelligent. Consumers have shown an interest in the functionality provided by cryptocurrencies. It is more effective to design something appealing to the consumer than push a flawed solution onto them. The cautious, slow progress of some central banks through many pilot implementations is probably warranted. A failed implementation of a CBDC would have far-reaching consequences. This cautious approach, however, must not take longer than necessary, and the optimum solutions, including trust, must be reached. Research into CBDCs recognizes that more needs to be done to understand this phenomenon. Consumer trust is an important factor in technology adoption. For this research we are considering the one-tier CBDC solution. This research found support for a model with six factors influencing trust in a CBDC. It found that trust in the CBDC did indeed encourage its adoption. The six factors that influence trust are the following: Trust in the government and the central bank issuing aCBDC. ructural Equation Modelling (SEM) is outlined. After that comes the analysis and results, the discussion of the findings, and finally the conclusion, which includes suggestions for future research."

The use of cash is declining over time in most countries, and the idea to offer a purely digital currency and payment system is not new. The operations of a CBDC can either be over one or two tiers. If it operates over one tier, a central bank provides an electronic wallet to the individual to use it. The Chinese e-CNY operates in this way. A CBDC that operates with two tiers essentially replicates the current design where a currency is issued by the central bank but private banks hold individuals' savings. CBDCs may introduce some risks that must be analysed and understood before an implementation. Inevitably, a greater reliance on technology makes cybersecurity risks more dangerous. A problematic implementation may lead to low adoption or reduce trust and confidence in CBDCs. with current currencies. Unlike current currencies the functionality of the digital wallet may also play a role and become a relative advantage."

                "text": "Early signs suggest that image and credibility influence trust (Tronnier et\u00c2\u00a0al., 2022) CBDCs once again change this relationship leaving any physical proof out of the equation. The new relationship between the trustor (citizen) and trustee (government and central bank) replaces previous physical assurances, with technology. Trust in the technology is important. Previous research has shown that trust in technology is different to trust in people. Institutional trust is defined as the consumer's perception that third-party organizations (not the one purchasing or making a sale) can effectively support the exchange. For CBDCs institutional trust will depend on the specific risks people and societies face. Trust in technology plays a role in the consumer trusting a CBDC because the reduced contact with humans, is replaced with an increased interaction with technology. Trust in a system can be influenced by functionality, helpfulness, and reliability."

In a similar way, this research puts forward a model that separates trust in CBDCs into (1) trust in institutions implementingCBDCs and (2)trust in a specific CBDC technology. The four hypotheses related to the influence of trust\u00c2\u00a0associated to the institutions involved in CB DCs are presented first. The eighth and final hypothesis tests whether trust positively influences the intention to use a CBDC."

The exact role of a government and a central bank may not be the same in all cases. In most cases, there is close cooperation between the government and the central bank. A guarantee is a formal assurance in writing that something will happen. Guarantees have a history of being used to reassure users of technology or consumers of financial services. Specific guarantees offered to the user of a CBDC will increase trust in the CBDC. The government already holds personal information of the consumer, this might increase trust. Reputation has been proven to influence trust in a variety of contexts involving technology. CBDCs implemented in other countries will increase trust in the CBDC."

This automation reduces human involvement and corruption. As human involvement is reduced, so is the need to trust humans. Despite the large volume of data provided by a typical consumer, this does not happen without some privacy concerns. Additional privacy features of the CBDC wallet app and back-end processes, such as anonymity, can reduce personal information privacy concern. rify that consumer trust in a CBDC does, indeed, encourage the use of CBDCs. The originality and contribution of this research lies primarily in the previous seven hypotheses, but the final hypothesis is necessary to confirm that trust plays a role."

As with the measurement model, several criteria must be met. PLS-SEM is not focused on model fit, and there is a debate as to whether estimations of fit it produces should be reported. There are three typical approaches to SEM analysis. The first is to test a model and the second is to compare alternative models. The third approach is to generate a model. This is achieved by first proposing an initial model and then making adjustments to improve the statistical support for it. The model fit did not change significantly as the SRMR for a saturated model remains at 0.051. The structural model was further explored with the bootstrapping method set to 5000 samples. The results were similar as illustrated in Table\u00c2\u00a06.5."
